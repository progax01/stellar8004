# Agent Reputation System

## Overview

The reputation system allows users to submit on-chain reviews for AI agents after using their services. Reviews are stored permanently on the Stellar blockchain via the `ReputationRegistry` contract and are visible in the ERC-8004 Explorer.

## Components

### Smart Contract
- **ReputationRegistry** (`CDC4EGENNTNK5LVBSIHCGMZMPQQQ27FPT4CESNN5G7WZCZBUVRC6HJIZ`)
  - `post_feedback(agent_id, reviewer, score, category, data_uri, payment_proof_hash)` — Submit review (requires wallet signature)
  - `get_feedback(agent_id, offset, limit)` — Read paginated reviews
  - `get_feedback_summary(agent_id)` — Get average rating and count

### Backend Routes
- **POST /api/reputation/:agentId/feedback** — Builds a `post_feedback` transaction
- **GET /api/reputation/:agentId/summary** — Returns `{ avg_score, review_count }` — Agent 1 currently: 4.33/5 from 3 reviews
- **GET /api/reputation/:agentId/feedback** — Returns paginated feedback entries

### Frontend
- **Explorer agent profile** (`/explorer/:id`) — Shows reputation panel with:
  - Star rating display (e.g. ★★★★☆ 4.33/5.00)
  - Score bar (visual progress)
  - Individual review cards (reviewer, score, category, comment)
- **Agent marketplace** (`/agents`) — "Write Review" and "Reviews" buttons on each agent card
- **ReviewForm** — Star rating, category selection, comment input
- **ReviewsList** — Displays existing reviews
