> **a Wallet, an Identity,**
> **and the Power to Pay.**

**Sub-headline (lighter, below headline):**

## SECTION 3 — Problem Statement (The "Why")

> 2-column layout or centered card. Short and punchy.

**Section label (small, muted):**
> THE PROBLEM

**Headline:**
> **AI agents are getting smarter. But they can't pay.**

**Body:**
> Today's AI agents can write code, browse the web, and manage your calendar — but the moment they need to pay for a service, buy an API call, or invest in DeFi, they hit a wall. They don't have wallets. They don't have identity. They have no way to transact.
>
> AgenticOcean fixes that.

**3 pain point cards (icon + title + one line):**

| Icon | Title | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 🔒 | No Wallet | Agents can't hold or spend funds autonomously |
| 👤 | No Identity | No verifiable on-chain record of who an agent is |
| 💸 | No Payments | Can't pay for APIs, data, or DeFi services inline |

---

## SECTION 4 — How It Works

> Numbered steps. Left-right alternating layout or vertical timeline.

**Section label:**
> HOW IT WORKS

**Headline:**
> **From zero to autonomous in 4 steps.**

---

**Step 1 — Create a Smart Vault**
> Deploy a personal USDC vault on Stellar in one click. Your vault is a Soroban smart contract that holds funds and enforces per-agent spending rules.
>
> `VaultFactory.create_vault()` → Your vault is live on-chain.

---

**Step 2 — Register Your Agent**
> Give your AI agent an on-chain identity. Every agent gets a sequential ID and a unique `@handle` — like an ENS name for your bot.
>
> `AgentRegistry.register("my-yield-bot")` → Agent identity minted.

---

**Step 3 — Set Spending Rules**
> Authorize your agent with a daily USDC limit and optional destination whitelist. The vault enforces these rules on every payment — no admin key needed.
>
> `vault.add_agent(agent, dailyLimit: 10 USDC)` → Policy set.

---

**Step 4 — Agent Pays via x402**
> Your agent hits a paid API endpoint, receives a `402 Payment Required` response, builds the payment, and settles 0.01 USDC on-chain — all without you lifting a finger.
>
> `GET /api/yield/query` → `402` → `X-PAYMENT: ...` → `200 OK + strategy`

---

## SECTION 5 — Core Features

> Card grid layout, 3 across. Each card has an icon, title, and 2-3 lines of description.

**Section label:**
> WHAT'S INSIDE

**Headline:**
> **Everything your AI agent needs to operate autonomously.**

---

**Card 1 — Smart Vaults**
Icon: 🔐
> Per-user Soroban smart contracts holding USDC. Fine-grained per-agent daily spending limits enforced entirely on-chain. Deposit, withdraw, and manage agent access without ever giving up your keys.

---

**Card 2 — Agent Identity (SRC-8004)**
Icon: 🪪
> Every agent gets a sequential on-chain ID and a unique `@handle` — first-come, first-served. Resolve any agent by name. Transfer ownership. Build reputation. Think ENS, but for your AI bot.

---

**Card 3 — x402 Micropayments**
Icon: ⚡
> The HTTP 402 payment protocol for Stellar. An agent sends a single signed header, the facilitator settles USDC on-chain atomically. Sub-second, trustless, no subscription needed.

---

**Card 4 — AI Yield Optimizer**
Icon: 🤖
> Multi-LLM yield strategy engine (Claude, Gemini, Groq, xAI — auto-detected from your key). Reads live rates from Blend Protocol + Soroswap. Returns a risk-adjusted allocation in seconds.

---

**Card 5 — Autonomous Rebalancer**
Icon: ♻️
> A cron-based rebalancer that runs every 5 minutes. Compares current DeFi positions against the AI's target allocation. Executes supply/withdraw operations automatically when drift exceeds 5%.

---

**Card 6 — Reputation + Validation**
Icon: ⭐
> On-chain feedback registry for every agent. Users rate agents 1–5 stars with category tags. Scores are computed as running averages on-chain — tamper-proof, permanent, transparent.

---

## SECTION 6 — x402 Payment Flow (Technical Deep Dive)

> Aimed at developers. Horizontal sequence diagram / animated flow.

**Section label:**
> THE x402 PROTOCOL

**Headline:**
> **Pay-per-use APIs for AI agents. No subscription. No API key sharing.**

**Sub:**
> x402 is an open HTTP payment protocol. A 402 response tells the agent exactly how much to pay and where. The agent pays, the server delivers. Settled on Stellar in under 5 seconds.

**Flow diagram (5 steps, left → right with arrows):**

```
Agent requests API          Server returns 402           Agent signs payment
GET /api/yield/query   →    { amount: 0.01 USDC,    →   SorobanAuthEntry signed
(no payment)                  payTo: facilitator }        with agent key

           ↓
Facilitator submits on-chain        →      Server delivers response
vault.agent_pay() → USDC transfer          200 OK + yield strategy + txHash
```

**Callout box:**
> 💡 The vault enforces the agent's daily spending limit on-chain. The facilitator cannot change the amount or destination. You stay in control — always.

---

## SECTION 7 — Explorer Preview

> Screenshot or mockup of the /explorer page. Visual section.

**Section label:**
> ERC-8004 EXPLORER

**Headline:**
> **See every agent, every payment, every review. On-chain. In real time.**

**Body:**
> The AgenticOcean Explorer is a live dashboard showing all registered agents, their 30-day activity charts, USDC payment history, action breakdown, and reputation scores — decoded from raw Stellar transactions into human-readable timelines.

**Feature list (3 columns, checkmarks):**
- ✅ Agent profiles with `@handle`
- ✅ Daily query + USDC spend charts
- ✅ Decoded transaction history
- ✅ Action breakdown by memo type
- ✅ On-chain reputation panel
- ✅ Global activity feed

**Visual:** Full-width screenshot or mockup of the Explorer page.

## SECTION 8 — Developer SDK

> Dark background card or code-block section. Targets developers.

**Section label:**
> DEVELOPER SDK

**Headline:**
> **Three packages. Drop-in ready.**

**Sub:**
> AgenticOcean ships as three TypeScript SDKs on npm. Integrate AI agent payments into your own app in under 30 lines of code.

---

**SDK Card 1 — `@agenticocean/vault`**
> TypeScript client for all 5 Soroban contracts — VaultFactory, UserVault, AgentRegistry, ReputationRegistry, ValidationRegistry.
```typescript
const registry = new AgentRegistry(REGISTRY_ADDRESS, config);
const agent = await registry.getAgentByHandle("yield-bot");
```

---

**SDK Card 2 — `@agenticocean/x402-stellar`**
> Build payment headers agent-side, gate your API server-side, settle payments on-chain.
```typescript
// Gate your route
app.use("/api/data", createX402Middleware({ price: "100000" }));

// Agent pays
const header = await buildX402Header({ vaultContract, agentSecret, payTo, amount });
```

---

**SDK Card 3 — `@agenticocean/defi-agent`**
> Multi-LLM yield optimizer + Blend SDK + Soroswap client + autonomous rebalancer.
```typescript
const strategy = await optimizer.optimize(
  "Best yield for 1000 USDC",
  "moderate"
);
// → 8.1% APY, 4-protocol allocation
```
